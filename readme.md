# Portfolio Project

Hello there! In this project, I have created a portfolio for myself where I can keep my projects, contact info, skills to showcase to other users. I have used HTML & Advanced CSS only to develop this project. 

# Features

There are multiple sections in this project : 

1) Home section where the user's photo and his/her profession's description is there along with a navigation bar.

2) Project section where the user can showcase his/her projects demonstrating his/her skills.

3) Information section where the user can give a brief description about himself/herself to the public.

4) Contact section where if a person want's to communicate with the user, he/she can enter the credentials and submit them to the user.

5) Footer section containing the Social Media & Contact links of the user for other person to follow the user's work.
